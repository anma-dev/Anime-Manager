1. Fork the repo
2. Clone your fork in your computer
3. Create a new branch for your changes
4. Push your changes to your branch and start a pull request

Make sure to check [the wiki](https://github.com/anma-dev/Anime-Manager/wiki/Debugging)

Make sure you have all appropriate dependencies installed 
(clone patched webtorrent-cli in lib folder)

Guidelines:

- POSIX compliant code is preferred
- To avoid the `local` bashism, the name of variables declared inside functions should be written in lowercase and be prefixed with the function's name separated by underscore (`function_name_var_name`).
- Function and variable names use lowercase with words separated by underscores.
- Constants use all caps, words separated by underscores.

Have fun! :D
