# ~ anime-manager

anime-manager is a powerful open source ([POSIX-compliant](https://github.com/anma-dev/Anime-Manager/tree/posix)) script that lets you watch (stream + torrenting) and synchronize your anime lists from your terminal.

You can use your existing anime list service (those [trackma supports](https://github.com/z411/trackma#currently-supported-websites)) to synchronize your lists as you watch anime by streaming or torrenting, all from one utility for added convenience!

- üîÑ Set series as completed or (re)watching as you go.
- ‚úÖ Set the current episode as watched and play the next one
- ‚ÜîÔ∏è Move series between lists
- üì£ Filter series by score or airing status
- üîÄ Play a random episode
- üëÅÔ∏è Watch history for quick access
- üëç Rate your series

and even more...
- üí° Switch between torrenting and streaming as you play
- üëâ Select a new torrenting or streaming source as you play
- üóÉÔ∏è Pick from matching files for batch torrents

It integrates the following functionality and tools:
- List sync ([trackma](https://github.com/z411/trackma))
- Episode search and streaming ([animdl](https://github.com/justfoolingaround/animdl))
- Episode search and torrenting ([NyaaPy](https://github.com/JuanjoSalvador/NyaaPy/) + [(patched) webtorrent-cli](https://github.com/anma-dev/webtorrent-cli))
- Beautiful menus ([fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/))

AM starts empty by default, with no account configured. You will have to configure Trackma with a acocunt separately for AM to work properly. The script will walk you through that.

### Dependencies
Python 3+ and modern bash or zsh.

| Dependency | Description |

Ensure all dependencies binaries are available through your `$PATH`.

### Installation

The script has an automatic install mode for dependencies that supports macOS and Ubuntu. Automatic install respects your existing installation. AM needs testers to extend to other platforms.

Just clone the repo and give exec permissions to anime-manager and put anime-manager in path.

Run the script to accept the terms and begin automatic installation of dependencies if your platform is supported.

### Usage
Run with

`$ anime-manager <arguments>`

We offer few options because the script is meant to be interacted with through the menus for most of the functionality.

#### Arguments

#### `-d`, `--debug`
Don't print the logo and enable debug mode.
#### `--small-logo`
Don't print the big, orange logo, print the small yellow one instead.
The default big logo includes some fun greetings for holiday seasons. Recommended!
#### `-v`, `--version`
Print the version number and exit.

### Support
Issues and suggestions are welcome! I give free support and development for issues and features that personally interest me so I don't promise that I will implement "X" feature.
